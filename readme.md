# Quake Log Parser

## **1. Introduction**

This project is a solution for the **Quake Log Parser** task, designed to parse a log file generated by a Quake 3 Arena server. The log file contains detailed information about matches, player actions, and kills.

The goal is to extract meaningful data, organize it by matches, and generate detailed reports, including player rankings and kill statistics.

## **2. Requirements**

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.
- **Go (Golang)**: To build and execute the application.
- **Docker**:  If you want to use docker.

## **3. Project Features**

This application is built to process Quake log files and extract key information from matches, including:

### **3.1 Log Parsing**

- Reads and parses the Quake log file.
- Groups data by matches (e.g., `game_1`, `game_2`).
- Tracks player kills, including cases where players are killed by `<world>`.

### **3.2 Match Data**

For each match, the application collects and displays:

- **Total kills**: Includes both player kills and `<world>` kills.
- **Players**: A list of unique players in the match.
- **Kill statistics**:
  - Tracks kills by each player.
  - Accounts for `<world>` kills, which deduct one point from the victim's score but do not count `<world>` as a player.

**Example Match Data:**

```json
"game_1": {
  "total_kills": 45,
  "players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],
  "kills": {
    "Dono da bola": 5,
    "Isgalamido": 18,
    "Zeh": 20
  }
}
```

3.3 Player Ranking

Generates a ranking of players based on their total kills across all matches.

3.4 Death Causes

Tracks and groups deaths by their means of death, such as MOD_SHOTGUN, MOD_RAILGUN, and others.

Example Death Cause Data:

```
"game_1": {
  "kills_by_means": {
    "MOD_SHOTGUN": 10,
    "MOD_RAILGUN": 2,
    "MOD_TRIGGER_HURT": 1
  }
}
```

### 4. Folder Structure

├── infrastructure/      # Technical concerns (e.g., file I/O, logging)
├── interfaces/          # Entry points (e.g., CLI, REST API)

Explanation of Key Directories

- application/: Contains the core logic for parsing logs and generating reports.
- domain/: Encapsulates the business logic, ensuring separation from infrastructure and technical concerns.
- infrastructure/: Manages external dependencies like file handling and logging.
- interfaces/: Handles user interaction, such as through a command-line interface (CLI).
- shared/: Contains reusable resources like configuration constants, logs file and test files.

### 6. How to Run the Application

6.1 Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
 • Go installed on your machine.
 • The Quake log file ready.

6.2 Build and Run

 1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd quake-logger

 2. Build the application:

> go build -o quake-logger

 3. Run the application:

> go run main.go

6.3 Using Docker

Run the container:

> docker-compose up -d

6.4 Run test

> go test ./shared/test

### 7. Reports

The application generates:

- A report for each match with total kills, player list, and kill statistics.
- A ranking of players across all matches.
- A summary of deaths grouped by means of death for each match.
